A simple web-based **Loan Calculator** that allows users to calculate their **monthly loan payments** based on loan amount, interest rate, and repayment duration.  

## 🚀 Features

## 📂 Project Structure  
```
├── index.html   # Main HTML file with input fields and button
├── style.css    # Styling for the Loan Calculator UI
└── index.js     # JavaScript logic for loan calculation
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** – For structure and input fields.  
- **CSS3** – For styling the user interface.  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – For loan calculation logic.  

## 📊 How It Works  
1. Enter the **Loan Amount** (e.g., $10,000).  
2. Enter the **Interest Rate** (e.g., 10%).  
3. Enter the **Months to Pay** (e.g., 12).  
4. Click on **"Calculate"**.  
5. The app displays the **Monthly Payment** immediately.  

The formula used:  
\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Loan Amount}}{\text{Months}} + \frac{(\text{Loan Amount} \times (\text{Interest Rate} / 100))}{\text{Months}}
\]
